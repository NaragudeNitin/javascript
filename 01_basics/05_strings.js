const name = 'Nitin';
const lastMatchScore = 0;

// console.log(name + " scored " + lastMatchScore + "in last match. holds record of most ducks in a in 5 match series");
//other way to concatinate string is 
console.log(`${name} scored ${lastMatchScore} in last match. Holds record of most ducks in a 5 match series`,);


//we can declare strings using constructor of string, that means using javascript object we can declare stringse
//eg;
const gameName= new String("Cricket");
